- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Emma
- :performing_arts: I currently work in costume but ..
- ðŸ‘€ I would like to move into front end development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, React and CSS
- :zap: I created a Wordpress template for my husband's website which you can see [here](https://leegale.co.uk)
- :confused: I'm looking for help with what direction to take and how to focus my learning
- :nerd_face: meanwhile I am mainly working on projects from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/emjogale) and the University of Helsinki [Fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com/en) course. I'm enjoying the course so much that I am also now interested in backend development :open_mouth:
- :sparkles: and also learning TDD with [LadiesofCode](https://ladiesofcodegroupsessions.github.io)
